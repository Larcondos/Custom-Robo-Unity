# Custom-Robo-Unity
An attempt at remaking as much of Custom Robo as possible, with some custom flair, using Unity.

In active development as of February 2019.

# Usage

# Roadmap (Major Releases Listed Only)

## Version 0.5 - ETA: Late February / Early March
- Local testing 'Battle' system entirely functional.
  - One of each weapon type and one mech functional.
  - AI will **NOT** be implemented.
  - Local multiplayer will **NOT** be implemented.
- Design will be complete.
- All segments of battles will be complete, so a battle could theoretically take place.

## Version 1.0 - ETA: Late March / Early April 2019
- Local Version of the game will be complete.
  - At least one of each weapon type and mech functional.
  - Local Battles will be possible.
  - Mech Customization will be possible (Regardless of how many parts are available).
- Should feel like the game it is based on at this point.

## Version 1.1a - ETA: April 2019
- VR will be possible.
  - As part of the school project this is based around, I intend on adding VR for the player controls. 
  - Additionally, this will put the full game into a first person POV, so that you can play the game in 1st person with or without VR.
    - VR 3rd Person would be unnecessary for a game of this type.

## Version 1.1b - ETA: May 2019
- Online version of the game will be complete.
  - The same functionality of Version 1.0 will be possible, but using online matchmaking.
    - This matchmaking will probably be very specific and not feature traditional matchmaking in AAA games.
