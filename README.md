# Custom-Robo-Unity
An attempt at remaking as much of Custom Robo as possible, with some custom flair, using Unity.

In finished/stalled development as of May 2019.
```diff
- The Version 1.0 is essentially the master branch. 
- Trying to take one project into 2 different paths has led to this project really becoming a mess. 
- As a result, the Virtual Reality section of this game and the finished game aren't getting a release.
- I have left the VR version in a separate branch for now, though I might some day try and fix it. 
+ If there is any major questions you have with this project feel free to email or message me.

# Roadmap (Major Releases Listed Only)
  - [See here for the full Planned Release Patchnotes ](https://trello.com/b/bJ2PUx2B/custom-robo)

## Version 0.5 - ETA: Released!
- Local testing 'Battle' system entirely functional.
  - One of each weapon type and one mech functional.
  - AI will **NOT** be implemented.
  - Local multiplayer will **NOT** be implemented.
- Design will be complete.
- All segments of battles will be complete, so a battle could theoretically take place.

## Version 1.0 - ETA: Finished, but not released.
- Local Version of the game will be complete.
  - At least one of each weapon type and mech functional.
  - Local Battles will be possible.
  - Mech Customization will be possible (Regardless of how many parts are available).
- Should feel like the game it is based on at this point.

## Version 1.1a - ETA: Finished, but not released.
- VR will be possible.
  - As part of the school project this is based around, I intend on adding VR for the player controls. 
  - Additionally, this will put the full game into a first person POV, so that you can play the game in 1st person with or without VR.
    - VR 3rd Person would be unnecessary for a game of this type.

## Version 1.1b - ETA: N/A
- Online version of the game will be complete.
  - The same functionality of Version 1.0 will be possible, but using online matchmaking.
    - This matchmaking will probably be very specific and not feature traditional matchmaking in AAA games.
